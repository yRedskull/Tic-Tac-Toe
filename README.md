## **📋 TICKETS GAME RULES**
* The board is a matrix of three rows by three columns.
* Two players choose a marking each, usually a circle (O) and an x (X).
* Players play alternately, one mark at a time, in an empty space.
* The objective is to get three circles or three crosses in a line, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and at the same time, when possible, prevent the opponent from winning on the next move.
* When a player achieves the objective, they usually cross out the three symbols.
* If both players always play their best, the game will always end in a draw.
